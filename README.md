# Hand-Sign-Recognition
 This is my first COMPUTER VISION MODEL coded in python and libraries used are ->[openCV, time, os, mediapipe, pickle, scikit-learn]. Also currently this model can detect 5 types of sign(YES, NO, HELLO, THANK YOU, PLEASE) but you can modify or add more signs as you want. Also this model predicts sign in real time
